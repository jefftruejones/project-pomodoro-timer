# project-pomodoro-timer

# Context

> * This is a pomodoro timer intended to help maximize a person's studying efficiency

# User: 

> * Any person who has a lot of information to learn or review could benefit from this application

# Use: 

> * Essentially, this application rotates between time intervals where one is supposed to focus or take a break.
At the end of each interval, an alarm rings letting the user know it is time to switch modes, either focusing or taking a break.

# Features: 

> * This project has multiple buttons where a user can increase or decrease the increments of time for focusing or taking a break. It has a 
progress bar to show how much time has passed, and a play, pause, and stop button.

# Technologies used: 

> * I created this application using React.js, HTML, and Bootstrap 4

# Discoveries: 

> * This application is definitely an exercise in state management, and I discovered how tricky it can be to be figure out which component is where.

# Future goals for this project: 

> * Right now, I use a lot of single state variables for functionality. In the future, I intend to clean up the code so there are only one or two state variables
as objects. Additionally, I would like to clean up the UI a little bit so it looks more attractive on different screens.

# Screenshots/Images: 

> * I don't currently have any screen shots, but the live app can be seen [here](https://project-pomodoro-timer-seven.vercel.app/)
